* As they explored deeper, the heroes came to a fork in the road. They chose to turn right and as they did the natural earthy tunnel broke way to a tunnel made of dwarven construction. They must be getting close!
* This dwarven pathway lead under a bridge and directly into a massive, natural rift. As if something gigantic tore from the very depths of Thylea. This rift looked bottomless.'
